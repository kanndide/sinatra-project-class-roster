## The purpose of this app is to help teachers keep track of their students and their email address. The idea is that the teacher could send out class level emails containing assignments, updates, and information pertaining to classes. With advancements in technology this may be a positive way to relay messages to young adults in a timely manner that they are able to keep up with on a regular basis.
